    - Connect to Castor once and retrieve dashboard data

      - What do you want to display?
        I want to show a bar chart where each bar represents the number of surgical procedures done
        within a given yearly quarter.

      - How to structure the data to make visualization easy?
        The most optimal data structure for this purpose is the histogram where each bin contains
        the quarter counts.

      - How to transform the data loaded from Castor to the structure needed for visualization?
        To build the histogram, you need surgery dates.

    x Connect to Castor every 5 seconds and retrieve list of studies
    x Deploy 1st version with dummy script
